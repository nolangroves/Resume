\section{Experience}
\cventry{June 2022 -- June 2023}{Data Analyst}{Affinaquest}{}{}{Worked to develop software implementing a complete pipeline to operate on client data, from the raw input all the way through to selecting and training machine learning models
\begin{itemize}
	\item Implemented machine learning algorithms, including XGBoost, Random Forest, and Logistic Regression, within predictive analytics using Python technologies such as scikit-learn, numpy, and pandas. 
\item Utilized extensive client databases for a classification problem, forecasting potential new donors from historical data
\item Developed a comprehensive data pipeline from scratch, integrating Python for data ingestion, cleaning, and feature extraction. 
\item Streamlined the process for delivering final predictions efficiently, specializing in solving the classification challenge of predicting potential new donors
\end{itemize}}
